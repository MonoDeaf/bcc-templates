Thank you for submitting your demo "{TRACK_NAME}" to {LABEL_NAME}. We appreciate you thinking of us and taking the time to share your music.

We wish you the best of luck with your music career and encourage you to keep creating and submitting to other labels that might be a better match for your style.
